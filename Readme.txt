*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.  
   To uncompress it use the following commands 
       % unzip LieFinalProject.zip

   Now you should see a directory named LieFinalProject with the files:
        main.cpp
	Grid.h
	Grid.cpp
	Player.h
	Player.cpp
	WaterVehicle.h
	WaterVehicle.cpp
	ship_placement.csv
	CSCI 2312 Object Oriented Final Project Design.pdf
        makefile
        Readme.txt

2. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd LieFinalProject 

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Run the program by:
   % ./finalproject

4. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
   %./make clean
